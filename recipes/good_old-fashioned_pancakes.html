        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces
        thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are
        probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>

        <h1>How to Make Pancakes</h1>
        <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe 
        below, but let's go over the basics:</p>

        <h2>Pancake Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong>: This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking powder</strong>: Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.</li>
            <li><strong>Milk</strong> and <strong>butter</strong>: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg</strong>: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Make Pancakes from Scratch</h2>
        <p>It's not hard to make homemade pancakes — you just need a good recipe. That's where we 
        come in! You'll find the step-by-step recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what 
        you can expect:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift the dry ingredients together.</li>
            <li>Make a well, then add the wet ingredients. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle or pan.</li>
            <li>Cook for two to three minutes, then flip.</li>
            <li>Continue cooking until brown on both sides.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>When to Flip Pancakes</h2>
        <p>Your pancake will tell you when it's ready to flip. Wait until bubbles start to 
        form on the top and the edges look dry and set. This will usually take about two to 
        three minutes on each side.</p>

        <h1>How to Reheat Pancakes</h1>
        <p>Store leftover pancakes in an airtight container in the fridge for about a week.
        Refrain from adding toppings (such as syrup) until right before you serve them so the 
        pancakes don't get soggy.</p>

        <h1>Can you Save Pancake Batter?</h1>
        <p>Don't let leftover pancake batter go to waste! Store the batter in an airtight 
        container in the fridge for up to two days. If you plan to keep it longer than that, 
        it's best to freeze the batter.</p>

        <h1>Can you Freeze Pancakes?</h1>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze pancakes and pancake batter.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To freeze cooked pancakes</strong>: Allow the pancakes to cool completely, then arrange
            them in a single layer on a baking sheet (make sure the edges aren't touching). 
            Flash freeze for a few hours or up to overnight. Reheat in an oven set to 350 degrees 
            F until warmed through</li>
            <li><strong>To freeze pancake batter</strong>: Ladle the pancake batter in serving size portions into 
            freezer bags, then wrap the bags in foil. Freeze flat for up to one month. Thaw in the 
            refrigerator overnight.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <p>Original recipe (1X) yields 8 servings</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl.

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto 
        the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and 
        the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. 
        Repeat with remaining batter.</p>
