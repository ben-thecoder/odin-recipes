        on top of a stainless steel grid which is on top of a white surface. Some muffins are 
        slightly or mostly cropped out of the picture; only two of them are entirely in the 
        picture. All muffins have already been baked and look very appetizing." height="400" width="600">
        <p>This blueberry muffin recipe is moist, sweet, and bursting with fruity flavor. A buttery 
        streusel topping takes this indulgent breakfast over the top.</p>
